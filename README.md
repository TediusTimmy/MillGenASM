I just wanted to get this up so that I have something to keep me honest and moving forward. It's a little strange in how it does things, but it was designed for hand-written assembly.

After a back-and-forth with Ivan: this thing is so bad that I feel bad. And I have no current motivation to make it better. Forgive me for this mess.
